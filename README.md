# CensorCraft API Template
An example template mod for the CensorCraft API.

Use this template to get started building a CensorCraft plugin to define your own punishment types. See the [wiki](https://github.com/FreshSupaSulley/CensorCraft/wiki/plugin) for help.

# Prerequisites
Download the latest CensorCraft API jars from the [latest release](https://github.com/FreshSupaSulley/CensorCraft/releases/latest) (you might need to check previous releases if the latest release doesn't update the API) and place them at `libs/censorcraft/api/X.X.X`, where `X.X.X` is the API version.
