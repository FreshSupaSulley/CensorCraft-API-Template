# CensorCraft API Template
An example template mod for the CensorCraft API.

Use this template to get started building a CensorCraft plugin to define your own punishment types. This requires grabbing the latest CensorCraft API jar from the releases in the [main repo](https://github.com/FreshSupaSulley/CensorCraft) and using it as a dependency.
