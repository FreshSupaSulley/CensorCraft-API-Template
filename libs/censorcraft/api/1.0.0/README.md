# HEY!

Put the CensorCraft API jars here! This folder should have these jars:

- `api-1.0.0.jar`
- `api-1.0.0-javadoc.jar`
- `api-1.0.0-sources.jar`

You can find these in the releases of the CensorCraft GitHub page (or at the very least v2.0.0). If this API gets absolutely any use, I'll put this on maven central instead.
